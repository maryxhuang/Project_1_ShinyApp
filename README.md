# Project_1_ShinyApp
Welcome to my ShinyApp Project!
My Project is based on the 1980-2014 US Homicide Report. 
The main goal is to explore the demographic distribution, 
the weapons used in the crime and how it has changed over time, 
and the relationship between perpetrators and victims.

The dataset and descriptions can be found in the following 
[link](https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports)
(The dataset itself is > 100MB therefore cannot be uploaded
to my GitHub repo. I restore the latest version of the codes & image)

And my ShinyApp is also running in my shinyapps.io account and can be 
found in the [link](https://maryxhuang.shinyapps.io/XH_Project1_ShinyApp/)

Thank you for your interests in my project!
